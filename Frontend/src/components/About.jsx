                        We leverage cutting-edge technologies and robust hardware systems to implement a highly precise machine learning algorithmâ€”the Random Forest. Our mission revolves around addressing a fundamental query for every farmer: "Which crop to cultivate?" By seamlessly inputting essential data on weather conditions and soil nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen, farmers gain tailored crop recommendations. We are committed to accessibility, working on innovative hardware solutions to ensure seamless data collection, even in remote villages. As an NGO dedicated to agricultural advancement, we empower farmers with data-driven insights to optimize their crop selection and yield outcomes.
